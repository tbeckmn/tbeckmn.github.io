## About

---

Digital marketing first caught my interest because it seemed like the perfect intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, psychology, and writing. As a journalism grad, I was looking to apply my skills in a fun and interesting way.

I got started at a couple digital marketing agencies in Portland, Oregon serving all kinds of SMB clients. I learned a lot about content marketing, social media marketing, email marketing, and SEO. But most of all, I learned how to think like a data-driven marketer through experimentation, analysis, and iteration.

After a few years, I moved back to the midwest and got my first in-house job at The Madison Concourse Hotel and Governor’s Club, an independent hotel in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. Working in-house is great because I get to geek out on one industry, and tourism and hospitality can be pretty fun.

I really enjoy creating content that’s engaging and useful for both businesses and customers. I can’t wait to see where digital marketing takes me next.

Other little tidbits about me:

- I can juggle.
- I make a mean veggie chili.
- I lived in Spain for a year teaching English to elementary school kids.
- I like playing 90s pop covers on the ukulele.
- I’m a huge tea nerd (some might say snob).
