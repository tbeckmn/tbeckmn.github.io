### Past Work

I started my career working for digital marketing agencies in Portland, Oregon. I created content mostly for small and midsized service busniesses with the goal of lead generation.

I filled the role of lead writer as well as managing editor of a team of writers and designers. Our team produced high-quality, strategy-driven content on schedule for websites, blogs, social media, and marketing emails.

I also worked with clients directly on content strategy and created analytics reports.
